Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area,4.5,NULL,NULL,NULL,"From exploring tide pools teeming with life to witnessing Oregon's tallest lighthouse, there is something for every visitor at Yaquina Head. Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area extends out from the Oregon coast, one mile into the Pacific Ocean. Standing 93 feet tall at the westernmost point of the basalt headland, the lighthouse has been a bright beacon of the night, guiding ships and their supplies along the west coast since the light was first lit on August 20, 1873. The offshore islands are a year-round refuge for harbor seals and a spring-summer home for thousands of nesting seabirds. Gray whales can be spotted during their annual migrations to Mexico (late fall-early winter) and Alaska (late winter-early spring). During the summer months some gray whales take the opportunity to feed in the shallow waters around the headland. Cobble Beach is compiled of millions of round basalt rocks that produce an applause-like sound as the waves roll in. When the tide is low a vibrant ocean floor is revealed—pools of colorful animals including orange sea stars, purple sea urchins, and giant green anemones. Rangers are at hand to answer questions and point out all of the amazing plants and animals that call the tide pools home. Visit the Interpretive Center and discover 140 years of lighthouse history and thousands of years of natural and cultural history. Friends of Yaquina Lighthouses, a non-profit organization, offers site-related books, maps, and postcards in their interpretive store.

Village Creek State Park,4.5, Biking Trails , Hiking Trails,NULL,"Explore the unique geology, topography, and unusual plant communities of Crowley's Ridge, a landform of rolling hills in eastern Arkansas's Mississippi Alluvial Plain. Crowley's Ridge, a geologic anomaly, is the most unusual of Arkansas's six major physiographic provinces, or natural divisions. It is covered with a lush, mixed hardwood forest including oak, hickory, and uncommon hardwood trees such as American Beech, Sugar Maple, Butternut, Basswood, Cucumbertree, Kentucky Coffeetree, and Tuliptree or Yellow Poplar. Village Creek State Park is one of five Arkansas state parks on Crowley's Ridge. At 6,911 acres, Village Creek is Arkansas's second largest state park in land area. Park interpretive programs and exhibits share the story of the natural and cultural heritage of Crowley's Ridge. Five park trails totaling seven miles allow hikers the opportunity to explore this forest on their own, or on a guided trail walk with a park interpreter. A multi-use trail system within the park offers both mountain biking and hiking. Anglers can fish for bass, bream, catfish, and crappie at the park's two lakes, Lake Austell and Lake Dunn. Launch ramps, boat docks, bait, fishing boats, electric motors, and pedal boats are available late-spring through Labor Day. Visitors can bring their own canoe or kayak for some scenic paddling. The park campground includes 96 campsites [24 Class AAA, five Class A, and 67 Class B sites (for RVs, tents, and horse campers)] around Lake Dunn. Nestled on a nearby ridge are the park's 10 fully-equipped cabins that feature kitchens and wood-burning fireplaces–ready for a comfortable weekend stay. At Lake Austell, picnic sites are near a sandy beach and sun deck. The park also includes four standard pavilions (one is enclosed), playgrounds, baseball and multi-use fields, and a driving range. Horseback riding is a popular activity at this park. Twenty-five miles of multi-use trails wind through the rolling hills of Crowley's Ridge. The horse trails are open throughout the year. Call the park for current trail conditions. The horse camp features 30 campsites with water and electric hookups, an asphalt parking pad, picnic table and grill; a modern bathhouse; horse wash bays; and 66 stalls inside the camping area. The horse stable's 10' x 10' stalls include water, electric, and ceiling fans. The park visitor center includes an A/V theater, store, gift shop, and bicycle rentals. The interpretive center offers a large meeting facility and The Discovery Room featuring exhibits of prehistoric artifacts and information about the wildlife of Crowley's Ridge. Our helpful park interpreters offer education-focused programs, concerts, and special events throughout the year. Golfers will enjoy The Ridges at Village Creek, the park's 27-hole, Andy Dye signature course. This public course features the rolling terrain of Crowley's Ridge, dramatic elevation changes, and the backdrop of the seasonal beauty of the surrounding hardwood forest. These combine with the PGA-caliber championship layout for an aesthetically pleasing and challenging level of play. Since 1923, the Dye family designs of resort and public courses have included world-ranked championship-class courses including 17 of the world’s top 100 courses. Dye designs have a worldwide reputation for their creative, unique designs, and environmentally sensitive integrity. Depending on the configuration of the two nines you choose to play, the yardage could stretch to over 7,400 yards. The course features MiniVerde Bermuda greens and Tiff 419 Bermuda tees and fairways. Four teeing areas make the course accessible for golfers of any skill level. Three distinct nines offer outstanding golf opportunities. Water comes into play on 12 holes. The course is open daily and includes a full-service clubhouse with pro shop, dressing rooms, snack bar, and full driving range. Golf carts are included with greens fee.",NULL,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/09/b2/a7/01/village-creek-state-park.jpg?w=100&h=-1&s=1,NULL,NULL

Beginning in 1900, Boldt's family shared four summers on Wellesley Island while 300 workers, stonemasons, carpenters and artists fashioned the six story, 120-room castle, complete with tunnels, a powerhouse, Italian gardens, a drawbridge and a dovecote. In 1904, tragedy struck. Boldt telegrammed the island and commanded the workers to immediately ""stop all construction."" Louise had died suddenly.

Hofwyl-Broadfield Plantation,4.5,NULL,NULL,9:00 AM - 5:00 PM,"This beautiful plantation represents the history and culture of Georgia’s rice coast. In the early 1800s, William Brailsford of Charleston carved a rice plantation from marshes along the Altamaha River. The plantation and its inhabitants were part of the genteel low country society that developed during the antebellum period. While many factors made rice cultivation increasingly difficult in the years after the Civil War, the family continued to grow rice until 1913.The enterprising siblings of the fifth generation at Hofwyl-Broadfield resolved to start a dairy rather than sell their family home. The efforts of Gratz, Miriam and Ophelia Dent led to the preservation of their family legacy. Ophelia was the last heir to the rich traditions of her ancestors, and she left the plantation to the state of Georgia in 1973.A museum features silver from the family collection and a model of Hofwyl-Broadfield during its heyday. A brief film on the plantation’s history is shown before visitors walk a short trail to the antebellum home. A guided tour allows visitors to see the home as Ophelia kept it with family heirlooms, 18th and 19th century furniture and Cantonese china. A stop on the Colonial Coast Birding Trail, this is an excellent spot to look for herons, egrets, ibis and painted buntings.

The first time I saw them it was love at first sight. That was it! From there on I knew what I wanted to do, I wanted to share the Auroras with the world and show them to everyone who doesn't have the opportunity to see the Northern lights. That's what I have been doing since. From long and cold nights photographing amazing auroras through the skies, and teaching northern lights photography workshops, to the summers explaining and showing the auroras to the ones that are not able to visit Alaska in the winters. I am a photographer in Alaska, living the dream life of many photographers.

The site served as an active dive-bomber squadron training facility from 1943 to 1945. Aircraft stationed at NAS Wildwood included TBM Avengers, Douglas Dauntlesses, Vought Corsairs and Curtiss Helldivers. Forty-two airmen perished while training at NAS Wildwood during World War II. In June 1997, NASW Foundation purchased Hangar #1 at the Cape May Airport. The 92,000 square-foot all-wooden structure was in a state of disrepair and required extensive renovation. Under the stewardship of NASW Foundation, the hangar was listed on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places at the National Significance Level. NAS Wildwood Aviation Museum now boasts over 26 aircraft displays as well as exhibits of military memorabilia, engines, photographs and more.

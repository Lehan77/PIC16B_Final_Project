# Travel Recommendation System

In this blog, our group (Haomin, Chloe, Johnny) will explain the utility and use-cases for our webapp, which is a travel recommendation system. Our website should be fairly intuitive to use since it only contains two fields to fill: city and interest. Afterwards, you may press the "search" button and it'll provide a list of potential locations to add to your itenerary. If you see an attractive location, you can add it to your saved plan.

Insert whatever we had from the google collab
